New businesses are tough.  Like, Really Tough.  Recently, my business partner
and I have finished setting up our new business, [Project Make
It](http://projectmakeit.com).  Basicly, we're putting our abilities out for
business.  Currently, we're focusing on web apps and sites, but are looking to
do larger backend systems.  Feel free to contact us at
[contact@projectmakeit.com](mailto://contact@projectmakeit.com).  This means my
old domain needed to be redirected to a new place, Here!  Again, this is a
blog, but hopefully this time things will keep happening.
