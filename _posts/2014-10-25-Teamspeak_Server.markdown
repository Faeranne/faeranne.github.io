Being a gamer, I've come to enjoy Multiplayer games like Minecraft and Artemis.
But how can one play these games with just text chat?  It's like I'm back on a
BBS.  Nope, not going to happen.

Enter TeamSpeak.  Probably the best thing to happen to voice-chatless games.
Most of you know what TeamSpeak is, but for those who don't, it's just a
multiclient voice server.  That means anyone who has access can join and talk
to others who are on the server.  It's like Google Hangouts or Skype, but it's
always there, and you don't have to have a invite to join.  In my case, we also
have several channels for when there's more than just a few of us on the
server.  One for each game we play.

If your a fan of games like Minecraft that have no voice chat, try TeamSpeak.
There are several servers already avalible, and you can host your own for free.
Go to [http://teamspeak.com/](http://teamspeak.com/) to find out more about it.

Also, if you are a part of my private server, you can see the server status
below.  That handy widget will let you know if anyone is on.
